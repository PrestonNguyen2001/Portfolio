# Professional Portfolio

# Introduction
This repository contains the solution to the Advanced CSS Challenge focused on developing a professional portfolio website. 

## Challenge Description
The challenge aims to provide employers with a platform to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples, enabling them to assess the candidate's suitability for an open position.


## Challenge Elements

### User Story
```markdown
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
### Acceptance Criteria
```markdown
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
## Solution
To address the challenge requirements, the following components were implemented:
- HTML (index.html): Structured the webpage with sections for the developer's name, photo/avatar, about section, work samples, and contact information. Utilized semantic HTML elements for accessibility and SEO optimization.
- CSS (styles.css): Styled the webpage to create an aesthetically pleasing and professional layout. Implemented responsive design principles to ensure compatibility across various screen sizes and devices.
- JavaScript (script.js): Added functionality to enable smooth scrolling to different sections of the webpage and to enhance user experience.
- Image Assets: Included high-quality images of the developer's applications to showcase their work effectively.

## Installation
The project can be accessed and viewed directly through the deployed website link:

Alternatively, you can clone the repository to your local machine for further exploration and customization. Here's how:
```markdown
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
```
